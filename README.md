# 🏥 Healthcare Chatbot

This project is a Python-based Healthcare Chatbot designed to assist users with basic health-related questions, provide symptom-based responses, and guide them toward appropriate actions or care when necessary. The chatbot aims to enhance accessibility to preliminary health information using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## 📌 Overview

The chatbot is trained on a set of predefined intents that mimic typical user queries in a healthcare setting. It leverages basic NLP techniques and machine learning to classify questions and provide appropriate responses.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Interface**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - NLTK
  - NumPy
  - TensorFlow / Scikit-learn
  - JSON
  - Random
- **Model**: Intent classification (ML or rule-based)
- **Data**: Intent file in JSON format (e.g., greetings, symptoms, advice)
